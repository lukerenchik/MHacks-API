    <h1>Braille Symbols for Addition</h1>
    <p>The braille symbol for addition is represented by the dots 3 and 4. It is used to indicate that two numbers should be added together.</p>
    <p>For example, the braille representation of the number 3 plus the number 4 is:</p>
    <pre>
     *
    **
    * 
    </pre>
    <p>This can be read as "3 plus 4 equals 7".</p>
