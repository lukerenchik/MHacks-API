    <h1>Introduction to Braille Symbols</h1>
    <p>Braille is a system of raised dots used by people who are blind or visually impaired to read and write. It consists of a series of cells, each containing six dots arranged in a grid of two rows and three columns. Each dot can be raised or not raised, and different combinations of raised and not raised dots represent different letters, numbers, and punctuation marks.</p>
