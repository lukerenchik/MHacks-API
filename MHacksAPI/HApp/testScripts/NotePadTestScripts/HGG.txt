The house 
stood on a 
slight rise
just on the 
edge of the 
village. It 
stood on its
own and 
looked over
a broad 
spread of 
West Country
farmland. 
Not a
remarkable
house by any
means â€“ it 
was about 
thirty years
old, 
squattish,
squarish, 
made of brick
and had four
windows set 
in the front
of a size and
proportion 
which more or
less exactly
failed to 
please the 
eye.
