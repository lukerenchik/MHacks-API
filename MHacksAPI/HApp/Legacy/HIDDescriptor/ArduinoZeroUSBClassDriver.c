# =============================================================================
#
# The USB Class Driver is a software module that implements the communication protocol and data format required by a specific class of USB devices. This example USB class driver is designed for a braille display with 15 solenoid valves as output and a touchscreen input.
#
# The class driver has several functions:
#
# begin(): Initializes the USB controller and sets up the device descriptor, configuration descriptor, and report descriptor.
# end(): Deinitializes the USB controller.
# handleControlRequest(USBSetup& setup): Handles USB control requests from the host computer, such as SET_REPORT and GET_REPORT.
# sendReport(uint8_t* data, int length): Sends a report to the host computer containing the state of the solenoids valves and the touchscreen input.
# getReport(uint8_t* data, int& length): Retrieves a report from the host computer containing commands to change the state of the solenoids valves.
# setSolenoidState(int solenoid, bool state): Changes the state of a specific solenoid valve.
# setTouchscreenData(uint16_t x, uint16_t y): Changes the touchscreen input data.
# The USB class driver implements the communication protocol and data format defined by the USB-IF (USB Implementers Forum) in the HID 1.11 specification (https://www.usb.org/document-library/hid-111) for Human Interface Devices. The HID class specification defines the standard communication protocol and data format that must be used by all HID devices, such as the format of the reports sent and received and the structure of the report descriptor.
#
# This USB class driver also uses the USB standard control requests defined by USB-IF in the USB specification (https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-31-specification-2) to handle communication between the host computer and the device. For example, the handleControlRequest(USBSetup& setup) function handles SET_REPORT and GET_REPORT control requests, which are used to send and receive reports, respectively.

#
# This is a high-level overview of what is needed to implement an HID compliant Braille Display with a touchscreen using the Arduino Zero. However, there are several other important aspects that need to be considered in order to make a complete and functional device.
#
# Hardware Interface: The Arduino Zero board needs to have the appropriate hardware interfaces to connect to the USB controller, the Braille Display, and the touchscreen. This would typically involve connecting the Arduino Zero's USB interface to the USB controller, and the other interfaces (I2C, SPI, or UART) to the Braille Display and the touchscreen.
#
# Low-level USB Communication: To implement the USB class driver, it's necessary to handle the low-level USB communication between the Arduino Zero and the host computer. This would typically involve writing code to handle USB packets, parse and generate USB control requests, and manage USB device state.
#
# Power Management: To ensure that the device is power-efficient and can operate for an extended period of time, it's necessary to manage the power consumption of the device, which can include implementing sleep modes and power saving features.
#
# Testing and debugging: Once the hardware and software are assembled, it's important to thoroughly test the device and debug any issues that may arise. This may involve using a USB protocol analyzer to examine the communication between the device and the host computer, and using a logic analyzer to examine the signaling on the various interfaces.
#
# Firmware updates and security: The firmware should be designed with the ability to be updated OTA (over-the-air) and to be secure.
#
# User interface and experience: The device should have a user-friendly interface and experience, which may involve creating a companion mobile or web application to configure the device settings, view status information, and troubleshoot issues.
#
# It's important to note that this list is not exhaustive and it may vary depending on the specific requirements of the project. It's also important to consult the documentation of the specific microcontroller and USB controller being used, as well as the USB standard that the device is using to understand the communication protocol and the format of the data being sent.
