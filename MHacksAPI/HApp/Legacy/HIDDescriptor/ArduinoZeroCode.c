# This is a rough example of how the code could look like, it uses the I2C protocol to send commands and receive data from the USB controller. The `setup()` function sends the commands to start monitoring the state of the D+ and D- lines, retrieve the device descriptor and set the address. The `sendCommand()` function sends commands to the USB controller, and the `getDeviceDescriptor()` function retrieves the device descriptor from the USB controller and prints it to the serial monitor.

# It's important to note that this example is not complete and it's missing error handling and some important parts of the code, it's only intended to give you an idea of how the code could look like. To implement a real-world device, you should consult the documentation of the specific USB controller and microcontroller you are using, as well as the USB standard that the device is using to understand the communication protocol and the format of the data being sent and also you should use the appropriate libraries and functions that are available in the Arduino Zero board.
